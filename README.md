# LiveKit Recording

All your recording needs, in one place.

## Worker

Simply deploy the [recorder service](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-recorder/tree/main/service), and your livekit server will handle the rest.

## Recorder

Want to record, but haven't made the switch to LiveKit yet? No problem! We built our [recorder](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-recorder/tree/main/recorder) to work with any provider (or any website, really).

## Templates

Use our pre-built recording [templates](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-recorder/tree/main/web), or create your own.
